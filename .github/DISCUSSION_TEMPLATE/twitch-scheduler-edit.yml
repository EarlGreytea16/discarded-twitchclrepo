        I end up not being able to add new features, fix bugs, review pull requests, etc. as fast as I wish because I have to spend too much time handling questions.

        All that, on top of all the incredible help provided by a bunch of community members, the [FastAPI Experts](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-people/#experts), that give a lot of their time to come here and help others.

        After submitting this, I commit to one of:

          * Read open questions until I find 2 where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.
          * I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
          * Review one Pull Request by downloading the code and following [all the review process](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/help-fastapi/#review-pull-requests).

        Please add a self-contained, [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) with your use case.

        If I (or someone) can copy it, run it, and see it right away, there's a much higher chance I (or someone) will be able to help you.
